	* CastorUtils : Castor::Point now holds a static array as it's members
	*   instead of a dynamic one.
	* Castor3D : Reviewed sorting function and render loop for alpha blended

	*   SceneFileParser, added <size> directive for viewport.

2013-03-27  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* CastorUtils : Improved FileParser, now functions have parameters and not
	*   only parameters types, and parameters parse themselves.

2013-03-25  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	*   Studio.
	* Reintegrated threaded render loop, the context is created in this thread
	*   if it is activated, else it is created in main thread.
	* Overlays are no more Renderable, there is one instance of OverlayRenderer
	*   class in the OverlayManager. All overlays will be rendered through this
	*   instance by the OverlayManager.
	* Modified a bit CMakeLists.txt and FindASSIMP.cmake in order to link debug
	*   or release libs using Visual Studio (using "optimized" and "debug"

	*   RenderTarget's frame buffer into the window.

2012-11-19  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Created GeometryBuffers class which holds a Vertex buffer and an Index
	*	buffer, they are created by the RenderSystem.
	* It allows the implementations to use API specific optimisations, like
	*	OpenGL Vertex Array Objects.

2012-11-14  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Frame buffers implemented in Castor3D.
	* GlRenderSystem and Dx9RenderSystem bindings Frame buffers are made.

2012-11-08  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Changed RenderTarget : now it only holds frame buffer and all needed for
	*	that.
	* It is now a Renderable so TargetRenderer has been created.

	* Implemented multisampling, tested and working on GLX.

2012-10-31  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Correcting HLSL shaders, done diff, diff-bump, diff-bump-spec,
	*	diff-bump-alph and diff-bump-alph-spec.
	* When initialising Pass, the texture units are re-ordered so the ones with
	*	a defined channel come first.
	* Corrected a bug in SMaxImporter, replaced eTEXTURE_CHANNEL_COUNT by
	*	eTEXTURE_CHANNEL_ALL which is more correct since the channels are flags
	*	and not indices.

2012-10-28  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Implemented intersection function in Line3D. 
	* That class now has to named constructors : FromPointAndSlope and 
	*	FromPoints, to avoid confusion between them.
	* Subdivider::DoComputeCenterFrom now uses Line3D::Intersects between the
	*	lines formed by the 2 points and their normals.
	* SMaxImporter now also imports bump, opacity and specular maps.
	* Scene::Render now takes a Camera in parameter to be able to sort nodes
