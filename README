Castor3D is a 3D engine written in C++.
It works on Windows and also on GNU/Linux.
It uses OpenGL (with GLSL) or Direct3D 9 (with HLSL).
Cg shader language is also supported.

#   **-----------------------------------------------------------------------**

Castor3D uses CMake to build project files.
You just need to launch cmake to build your preferential projet file.
Tested compilers are :
- Visual Studio 2010
- gcc 4.6.2
- gcc 4.7.0
CastorUtils depends on boost thread, FreeImage and FreeType.
Castor3D is based on CastorUtils and also uses NVidia's Cg Toolkit.
GlRenderSystem depends on OpenGL (not GLU).
Dx9RenderSystem uses Direct3D 9.
GuiCommon depends on wxWidgets (from 2.8.11, currently on 2.9.3).
Last (but not least) CastorViewer depends on GuiCommon, Castor3D and wxWidgets.
Few plugins are also built : importers (ASE, 3DS, OBJ, PLY, MD2, MD3) and
one divider (Loop algorithm).
Two additional projects are also generated : ImgToXPM and ImgToICO.
Documentation for CastorUtils and Castor3D can be generated using Doxygen.

On GNU/linux the default install directory is in /usr/local.
You can change this directory by changing the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX value.
The main application is installed in <install_dir>/bin/
The library LibGenerator (used to build your own plugins) is installed in
<install_dir>/lib/
The plugins are installed in <install_dir>/shared/Castor3D/

#   **-----------------------------------------------------------------------**

To run Castor Viewer, simply type 'CastorViewer' in your preferred
command-line.

1. I need a feature that Castor3D do not implement, what should I do ?

There are two ways.
First, Castor3D is a LGPL software and library, so you are welcome to improve
it yourself ;-) !
Second, just ask the author :-) ! 

2. I implemented a cool feature, can I commit it ?

Obviously you are welcome to send the author any improvement. But obviously
the author is quite careful with readability, correctness and stability, 
and will read and check any contribution before including it.
Thus, it can take time... There are few basic rules to write contributions:
- (1) Do never change the indentation of any part of the code that's not yours.
- (2) Do never send codes without a lot of comments in (bad or good) english.
- (3) Do never send codes with obscure and/or non-english variable names.

3. How can I ask the author ?

Just send a mail to dragonjoker59@hotmail.com !
